# 8Puzzle

In this folder, there is a src and bin folder. 
In order to compile the code, you will have to navigate to the src folder to compile the java programs using javac *
However, I have attached the .class files in the bin folder so you can skip the previous step and simply run the .class files in the bin folder using java PuzzleSolver
When you run the PuzzleSolver program you will be prompted whether you want to enter your own state or generate a random state.
You can also use java PuzzleSolver (Integer) with an integer value which will run the program with n random initial states.
